Descartes (1596 - 1650)</h3> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">René Descartes, a prominent philosopher and scientist, made significant contributions to the development of modern science through his core beliefs and methodologies. Here is a summary of Descartes’ core beliefs about science:</p> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=6 data-line-end=7 ><a id="Foundational_Beliefs_and_Methodology_6"></a><strong>Foundational Beliefs and Methodology</strong></h4> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="9"><strong>Method of Doubt</strong>:<br> Descartes is well-known for his method of systematic doubt, which involves questioning the certainty of all beliefs until only indubitable truths remain. This approach is encapsulated in his famous dictum, <em>cogito ergo sum</em> (“I think, therefore I am”), which he considered the first principle of his philosophy.</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="14"><strong>Deductive Reasoning</strong>:<br> He emphasized the use of deductive reasoning, akin to mathematical proofs, to derive knowledge from self-evident truths. Descartes believed that scientific knowledge should be built from clear and distinct ideas, much like the axioms in geometry. <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="14"><strong>Mechanical Philosophy</strong>:<br> Descartes viewed the natural world as a machine, governed by laws that could be understood through mathematics and physics. He rejected the Aristotelian view of nature, which relied on final causes or purposes, in favor of explaining natural phenomena through mechanical principles.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=14 data-line-end=15 ><a id="Role_of_Experimentation_and_Observation_14"></a><strong>Role of Experimentation and Observation</strong></h4> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="17"><strong>Integration of Empiricism</strong>:<br> Although Descartes is often associated with rationalism, he did not dismiss the importance of observation and experiment. He believed that while general principles could be known a priori, specific phenomena required empirical investigation to understand their properties and mechanisms.</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18"><strong>Hypothetico-Deductive Method</strong>: Descartes advocated for the formulation and testing of hypotheses through experiments. He recognized that multiple hypotheses could explain a phenomenon, and empirical testing was necessary to determine their validity.</li> </ul> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=18 data-line-end=19 ><a id="Science_and_Philosophy_18"></a><strong>Science and Philosophy</strong></h4> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="21"><strong>Science as a Unified System</strong>:<br> Descartes saw philosophy as the foundation of all sciences, with metaphysics as the root, physics as the trunk, and other sciences like medicine and ethics as branches. He believed that a complete understanding of science required a philosophical basis.</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22"><strong>Science and Religion</strong>: Descartes did not see science as incompatible with religion. He believed that scientific reasoning could coexist with theological reasoning, and he sought to demonstrate the existence of God through rational argumentation. Descartes’ contributions laid the groundwork for the Scientific Revolution by promoting a systematic and rational approach to scientific inquiry, blending deductive reasoning with empirical methods, and challenging the prevailing Aristotelian views of his time.</li> </ul> <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=22 data-line-end=23 ><a id="2_Popper_1902___1994_22"></a>2. Popper (1902 - 1994)</h3> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=24 data-line-end=25 ><a id="Falsifiability_and_the_Scientific_Method_24"></a><strong>Falsifiability and the Scientific Method</strong></h4> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26"><strong>Falsifiability as a Criterion</strong>:</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">Popper argued that for a theory to be considered scientific, it must be falsifiable. This means that it should be possible to conceive an observation or an experiment that could refute the theory[6][7].</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28"><strong>Empirical Testing</strong>: He emphasized that scientific theories cannot be proven true but can only be tested and potentially falsified through empirical evidence[6][7].</li> </ul> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=28 data-line-end=29 ><a id="Critical_Rationalism_28"></a><strong>Critical Rationalism</strong></h4> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30"><strong>Conjectures and Refutations</strong>: Popper proposed that scientific knowledge grows through a process of making bold conjectures and then attempting to refute them. This process of trial and error is central to scientific progress[2][3].</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31"><strong>Rejection of Induction</strong>: He rejected the classical inductive approach to science, which seeks to derive general principles from specific observations, arguing instead for a deductive approach[6].</li> </ul> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=31 data-line-end=32 ><a id="Objective_Knowledge_31"></a><strong>Objective Knowledge</strong></h4> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33"><strong>Objective Truth</strong>: Popper maintained that the pursuit of truth is a fundamental goal of science, even though absolute truth may be unattainable. He viewed truth as a regulative ideal that guides scientific inquiry[3].</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="33" data-line-end="35"><strong>Ethical and Political Implications</strong>: Popper linked his scientific philosophy to broader ethical and political ideas, advocating for liberal democracy and open societies where ideas can be freely criticized and tested[6].</li> </ul> <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=35 data-line-end=36 ><a id="3_Kuhn_1922__1996_35"></a>3. Kuhn (1922 - 1996)</h3> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=37 data-line-end=38 ><a id="Thomas_Kuhns_Core_Beliefs_about_Science_37"></a><strong>Thomas Kuhn’s Core Beliefs about Science</strong></h4> <h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=38 data-line-end=39 ><a id="Paradigm_Shifts_and_Scientific_Revolutions_38"></a><strong>Paradigm Shifts and Scientific Revolutions</strong></h5> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40"><strong>Normal Science and Paradigm Shifts</strong>: Kuhn introduced the concept of “paradigm shifts” to describe how scientific progress occurs. According to Kuhn, science operates within paradigms—frameworks of theories and practices—that guide normal scientific research until anomalies lead to a crisis and a subsequent paradigm shift[4][5][8].</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="40" data-line-end="41"><strong>Scientific Revolutions</strong>: He argued that scientific revolutions are non-cumulative developmental episodes in which an older paradigm is replaced in whole or in part by an incompatible new one[4][8].</li> </ul> <h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=41 data-line-end=42 ><a id="Incommensurability_and_Theory_Change_41"></a><strong>Incommensurability and Theory Change</strong></h5> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="42" data-line-end="43"><strong>Incommensurability</strong>: Kuhn proposed that competing paradigms are often incommensurable, meaning they cannot be easily compared or evaluated against one another using a common standard[4].</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44"><strong>Role of History in Science</strong>: Kuhn emphasized the importance of historical context in understanding scientific development, arguing that science is not a linear progression but is influenced by historical and social factors[5][8].</li> </ul> <h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=44 data-line-end=45 ><a id="Impact_on_Philosophy_of_Science_44"></a><strong>Impact on Philosophy of Science</strong></h5> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="46"><strong>Critique of Logical Positivism</strong>: Kuhn’s ideas challenged the logical positivist view of science as a steady accumulation of knowledge, instead highlighting the discontinuities and revolutionary changes in scientific history[4][8].</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="48"><strong>Influence on Other Disciplines</strong>: The concept of “paradigm shifts” has been widely adopted beyond the philosophy of science, influencing fields such as sociology, business, and education[8]. Both Popper and Kuhn significantly influenced the philosophy of science, with Popper focusing on falsifiability and critical rationalism, and Kuhn emphasizing the historical and revolutionary nature of scientific change.</li> </ul> <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=48 data-line-end=49 ><a id="4_Feyerabend_1924__1994_48"></a>4. Feyerabend (1924 - 1994)</h3> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="51">Paul Feyerabend’s philosophy, particularly in the realm of the philosophy of science, is characterized by several central themes and concepts that challenge traditional views. His most notable work, <em>Against Method</em>, lays the foundation for what he termed “epistemological anarchism.” Some of his most central points of philosophy are:</p> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=52 data-line-end=53 ><a id="1_Epistemological_Anarchism_52"></a>1. <strong>Epistemological Anarchism</strong></h4> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="53" data-line-end="54">Feyerabend argued against the existence of a universal scientific method, positing that scientific progress often occurs through ad-hoc hypotheses and deviations from established rules. He famously stated that “anything goes” in the pursuit of knowledge, emphasizing that rigid adherence to methodological norms can hinder scientific advancement[3][5].</p> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=55 data-line-end=56 ><a id="2_Critique_of_Rationalism_55"></a>2. <strong>Critique of Rationalism</strong></h4> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="56" data-line-end="58">Feyerabend critiqued rationalist approaches that attempt to impose strict methodologies on scientific inquiry. He believed that the greatest scientists often operated outside of these prescribed methods, suggesting that creativity and opportunism are essential for scientific breakthroughs. This perspective aligns with his view that science should not hold a privileged status in society[1][3][5].<br> Here, he uses three different examples:</p> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="58" data-line-end="59">Xenophanes against Homer</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="60">Galileos Methodology</li> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="60" data-line-end="61">Vertical-fall argument against the earths motion</li> </ul> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=63 data-line-end=64 ><a id="3_Paradigm_Shifts_and_Historical_Context_63"></a>3. <strong>Paradigm Shifts and Historical Context</strong></h4> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="64" data-line-end="65">Influenced by Thomas Kuhn, Feyerabend acknowledged that scientific paradigms shape the interpretation of phenomena. However, he extended this idea by arguing that the transition from one paradigm to another is not purely rational but often involves non-scientific factors, including social and cultural influences. He maintained that historical context plays a crucial role in scientific development[3][4].</p> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=66 data-line-end=67 ><a id="4_Relativism_and_Pluralism_66"></a>4. <strong>Relativism and Pluralism</strong></h4> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="68">Feyerabend’s views led him to a relativistic stance, where he argued that no single scientific theory could claim absolute truth. Instead, he advocated for a pluralistic approach to knowledge, where multiple perspectives and methodologies coexist and contribute to a broader understanding of reality[2][5].</p> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=70 data-line-end=71 ><a id="5_Science_and_Society_70"></a>5. <strong>Science and Society</strong></h4> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="71" data-line-end="72">Feyerabend contended that since there is no universal scientific method, science should not dominate other forms of knowledge or cultural practices. He believed that various epistemologies should be valued equally, fostering a more democratic and inclusive approach to knowledge production[3][5].</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="73" data-line-end="74">In summary, Feyerabend’s philosophy challenges traditional notions of scientific methodology, advocating for a more flexible, pluralistic, and context-sensitive understanding of science and knowledge. His ideas have sparked significant debate and continue to influence discussions in the philosophy of science and beyond.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="75" data-line-end="81">Citations:<br> [1] <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/</a><br> [2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend</a><br> [3] <a href="https://antimatter.ie/2011/02/13/the-philosophy-of-paul-feyerabend/">https://antimatter.ie/2011/02/13/the-philosophy-of-paul-feyerabend/</a><br> [4] <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350406403_Introduction_Paul_Feyerabend%27s_Philosophy_in_the_Twenty-First_Century">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350406403_Introduction_Paul_Feyerabend's_Philosophy_in_the_Twenty-First_Century</a><br> [5] <a href="https://blog.oup.com/2017/03/paul-feyerabend-philosophy-science/">https://blog.oup.com/2017/03/paul-feyerabend-philosophy-science/</a></p> <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=84 data-line-end=85 ><a id="5_Developments_After_Kuhn_and_Feyerabend_84"></a>5. Developments After Kuhn and Feyerabend</h3> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="85" data-line-end="86">After the influential works of Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend, the philosophy of science continued to evolve in several directions:</p> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=87 data-line-end=88 ><a id="NeoKantian_Interpretations_and_Cognitive_Psychology_87"></a>Neo-Kantian Interpretations and Cognitive Psychology</h4> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="88" data-line-end="89">Paul Hoyningen-Huene, who worked with Kuhn, developed a neo-Kantian interpretation of Kuhn’s ideas, focusing on the changeable nature of the phenomenal world as paradigms shift. This interpretation highlights the theory-dependence of observation and incommensurability. - Advances in cognitive psychology have been used to further explore Kuhn’s ideas. Researchers have drawn parallels between Kuhn’s concepts and cognitive structures, emphasizing the role of conceptual change in scientific revolutions.</li> </ul> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=89 data-line-end=90 ><a id="Scientific_Realism_and_PostKuhnian_Thought_89"></a>Scientific Realism and Post-Kuhnian Thought</h4> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="90" data-line-end="91">By the end of the 1980s, a new form of scientific realism emerged, integrating lessons from general philosophy of language and epistemology. This realism embraced the possibility of objective knowledge and justification, contrasting with Kuhn’s rejection of such positions. - Kuhn’s work influenced various fields, including social sciences and humanities, where his ideas on paradigms and paradigm shifts have been applied to understand changes in disciplines like economics and political science.</li> </ul> <h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=91 data-line-end=92 ><a id="Systematicity_Theory_91"></a>Systematicity Theory</h5> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="92" data-line-end="93">Paul Hoyningen-Huene proposed systematicity theory as a new framework for understanding science. This theory suggests that science is distinguished by its systematic nature compared to other forms of knowledge. It aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of science beyond the fallibility emphasized by Kuhn and Feyerabend.</li> </ul> <h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=93 data-line-end=94 ><a id="Philosophy_of_Science_in_the_21st_Century_93"></a>Philosophy of Science in the 21st Century</h4> <ul> <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="94" data-line-end="95">The contemporary philosophy of science faces the challenge of avoiding naive abstraction while achieving a level of generality that transcends specific sciences. This involves balancing methodological rigor with the recognition of the diverse and context-dependent nature of scientific inquiry. Overall, the post-Kuhn and post-Feyerabend era in the philosophy of science has seen a shift towards integrating insights from cognitive science, embracing scientific realism, and exploring new theoretical frameworks like systematicity theory to account for the complexity and diversity of scientific practices.</li> </ul> <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=97 data-line-end=98 ><a id="Modelling_97"></a>Modelling</h2> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="98" data-line-end="100">What are models and what happens when we try to build them?<br> I tried to answer this question in <a href="models_and_other_mysteries.md">this page</a></p> <h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=102 data-line-end=103 ><a id="Information_turning_into_Ideas_102"></a>Information turning into Ideas</h2> <h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=103 data-line-end=104 ><a id="Dawkins_Memes_103"></a>Dawkins Memes:</h3> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="104" data-line-end="105">Dawkins coined the term “meme” in his 1976 book “The Selfish Gene” to describe a unit of cultural transmission or imitation. He proposed that just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperm or eggs, so too do memes propagate themselves in the “meme pool” by leaping from brain to brain.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="107" data-line-end="108">Dawkins defined a meme as a “unit of cultural transmission” - any idea, behavior, skill, or other phenomenon that gets passed from person to person by means of imitation, teaching, or other forms of social transmission. Examples of memes given by Dawkins include tunes, ideas, catchphrases, fashion, and the technology of building arches.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="110" data-line-end="111">Dawkins saw memes as analogous to genes in their capacity to replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures. He hypothesised that memes evolve by a process of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, in a way similar to the evolution of biological organisms.</p> <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="112" data-line-end="113">Dawkins believed that the meme is the cultural equivalent of the gene, and is just as essential to understanding human culture and evolution as the gene is to understanding biological evolution</p>
