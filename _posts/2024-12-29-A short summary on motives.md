# A short summary on motives (Work in Process) 


## Overview: 

Life is to a large degree shaped by actions taken (and actions not taken), but what shapes those actions? What guides humans in their own philosophy of action and consequently, what does really drive our actions? 


### Heckhausen's Theory [^1]
 While a share of human acitivites is overt/directly observable by others, some acitivies also have a more covert side in the mental activities of 
- experiencing,
- perceiving, 
- thinking
- feeling 
- imagining


hence the scope of human activity thus ranges from dreaming (Klinger, 1971) to preplanned, intentional acts. 

*The **psychology of motivation** is specifically concerned with activities that reflect the pursuit of a particular goal and in this function form a meaningful unit of behavior. Motivational research seeks to explain these units of behavior in terms of their whys and hows.*


But what are general characteristics of human actions? 

*Heckhausen* claim that the follwoing two attributes characterise human action universially: 

1. The strive for control
2. The organisation of goal engagement and goal disengagnement

which are an outcome of behavioral evolution and anything but a give, moreover, the function they fulfill in guiding and organizing the organism’s activities is highly adaptive


#### Control Striving
*White (1959)*[^2] claims the striving for control to be a part of the motivational makeup of our species.

in fact, control striv- ing is not unique to humans but is an outcome of behavioral evolution in all mammals and possi- bly all species that are mobile and thus in need of general mechanisms of behavioral regulation. Under changing environmental conditions, the organism can thus stay focused on the aimed for outcome as a guideline to modify its behavior (see the overview in  *J. Heckhausen, 2000; Schneider & Dittrich, 1990*).


However, comparative and evolutionary psychology has virtually ignored the motivational and volitional control of behavior. Yet there are both theoretical and empirical reasons for assuming that a set of basic motivational modules regulates control striving and control-related behavior.

One example is the universal motivational system in mammals that engages the organism with the goal of extending its rang of control over the external environment. 


The first manifestations of control striving in human ontogenesis can be observed in neonates *(Janos & Papoušek, 1977; Papoušek, 1967)[^3].*



According to Heckenhausen (2008)[^1]
*Human action consists of organized behavior and experience. Perceptions, thoughts, emotions, skills, and activities are coordinated to facilitate either the attainment of goals or disengagement from unattainable or futile goals.*
