Welcome to my small collective space of thoughts, tools and tricks. 

My name is Dominik and I am deeply curious about Knowledge (Graphs), Semantics, Cognition, Limitations of modelling. Here I am aiming to connect Computer Science, Mathematics, Philosophy and People.
With the help of this blog, I am trying to do more by doing less. 
More of the stuff that really matters and less of the cluttering dust of unimportantness.
